Programming session 2 - Nicholas and Zach

In this session, we're properly displaying wav file info to where it is synced with music if it were played and
	we're only using the data that we need to display for every 735th sample, with a sample rate of 44100, at
	60 frames per second.

First we fixed the issue with having an old output file. We detected the file and made it delete the former output.txt.
Then we tackled the issue of optimizing the code so that it could be synced to the music when the time comes. We got stuck
on this and decided to go out and buy a whiteboard. Once, we bought the whiteboard we tackled the update method. The first 
thing we needed to was read through the output file. Then we needed make update populate an array which would then display
to the "render" array which is displayed on screen. The update function runs 60 times per second so every time we run the 
update function we shift everything in the displayed array over and get rid what's in array index zero.

Some problems we ran into were getting the display to work properly and figuring out how we needed to shift the display
array. At first we thought we needed a temp variable but we found that we didn't need to read back to front and needed to 
read front to back. This is the reason we got the white board.

Next session we plan on implementing this into our 3d wave generator.
