Sprint 1 Retrospective

Good:
- We completed all goals from the GUI aspect, now just left to finishing touches
- We can decode data from WAV files and display it
- The early version of the visualizer works

Bad:
- Misscommunication between partners of what needs to get done
- Problems with github managmenet
- Optimization problems
- Learning while coding makes progress seem non-existent even though we are progressing

Changes:
- More full group discord meetings
- Try to free up more time
- Frequent merge to master to avoid commits behind or ahead
